3 types for doing the inheritance 

Person -> Student
    	-> Professor	

1/ single table , 

we will create a column for person ( col for student and professor )
some values will be null in the same table

INCONV : we will allocate for memory for nothing 

2 / TABLE_PER_CLASS
	each child has its own table

3 / JOINED TABLE
 the person table will contain the foreign key of the child table
